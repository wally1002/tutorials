# Tutorials

In this repo, I will try to add some tutorials on robotics. This is for beginners with very intuitive explanations. Hoping these will get progressively better.

  2. [Turtlesim](https://github.com/wally1002/tutorials/blob/main/posts/Turtlesim.md) - Turtlesim and rostopics.
  3. [Move the turtle](https://github.com/wally1002/tutorials/blob/main/posts/Move%20the%20turtle.md) - Rostopic pub and python code control.
